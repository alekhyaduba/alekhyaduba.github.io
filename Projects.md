## Projects


### Auto Drive Challenge.

_Perception, Computer Vision, YOLO, OpenCV_

- Experimenting to find efficient ways to enable an autonomous vehicle to detect the speed signs in real time accurately.

- Identify the speed sign and read the speed limit and pass the information to the system.

### Fast Traffic Light Detection and State Classification

_Computer Vision, YOLO, CNNs, OpenCV, Darknet_

[GitHub](https://github.com/alekhyaduba/TrafficLightDetectionClassification)

• Used Bosch traffic light dataset to train a YOLOV4 framework to detect and classify 8 traffic light states for traffic light
signal sizes as small as 20x20 pixels and tried different data augmentation techniques for robust model training.

• Created a pipeline to extract 11k bounding boxes from the Bosch dataset using the YOLOv4 Darknet framework, crop
and match the bounding boxes with the ground truth, to feed into a classification model that gave 91% accuracy.

• The CNN classifier on cropped images outperformed YOLOv4 classification accuracy by 10% and was 15% faster.


### Maximum Bandwidth Path - Graph Theory

_Graph Theory, Kruskals, Dijkstra, Heaps, Object Oriented Program (OOPs)_

[GitHub](https://github.com/alekhyaduba/MaximumBandwidth)

• Engineered a class to simulate random dense graphs representing real-world networks with user-defined density. It can
generate a graph of 5000 nodes with 1000 as the average degree of vertices to simulate a dense network, within 8secs.

• Implemented a custom Priority Queue using Max Heap with operations having O(log n) time complexity. This was used
to determine Max Bandwidth Path in Dense and Sparse graphs using large-scale Dijkstra and Kruskals algorithms.


### AdaBoost with CNNs for Class Imbalance in multi class dataset

_AdaBoost, CNN, Keras, Tensorflow, CIFAR-10_

• Developed a method to extract imbalanced sub dataset from a given balanced dataset for realistic tests.

• Implemented AdaBoost with CNNs as the base classifiers and compared the results with a single CNN network.

• Analyzed the observations of AdaBoost with CNN’s performance specifically for imbalanced multi class dataset.

### Implementing RL algorithms using Open AI gym environments

_OpenAI Gym, Python_

•Implemented Q learning and SARSA algorithms to discrete state space environments of Open AI gym.

•Implemented Q learning and SARSA to continuous state space environment of
“Mountain Car” and observed the limitations of the said methods.

•Implemented DQN (Deep Q Network) algorithm; a combination of Q learning and
neural network to solve the “Mountain Car” problem.

•Using DQN, the “Mountain Car” problem was solved with stabilized results
achieved in less than 300 episodes.
