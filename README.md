# About me -
I am one who likes to build Intelligent Systems that takes away the redundant work and allows us to work on new and exciting problems.

In few words, solving problems is what gives me the high and monotonocity is what I dread.

I am currently pursuing my **Master’s degree in Computer Science** and my primary focus is in the field of **Applied Machine Learning**.
I have worked on projects exploring the fields of **Computer Vision/ Perception, Machine Learning Algorithms and Graphs**.

I have 6+ years of experience as a Software/Systems Engineer.

In my previous roles I have worked as:
- **Test Owner** : 
I led a team of manual and automation testers and ensured the quality of a pilot SCADA product right from user story break down phase to Integration and System testing phase.
I was the youngest SME and Test Owner for one of the innovation line pilot project at Siemens DDI. I also worked and collaborated with multiple cross functional scrum teams at different phases. 
 
- **Automation Design Engineer**:
I developed windows form applications to automate the user stories comprising of desktop applications and websites (Selenium framework wrapper). Often when time permits, I used to design and build mini frameworks that would reduce the user story automation time.

- **Database Analyst**:
I worked with finance data of one of the Big 4 companies, and validated their reporting system's results. I designed SQL queries and stored procedures to validate the data in the reporting system and was able to uncover 45% more issues than what were possible through UI testing. I also worked closely with DBA to detect the discrepencies if any early on in the software cycle. I was awarded on multiple occasions for my contributions.
