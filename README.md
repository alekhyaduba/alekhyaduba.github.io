I am interested in building Intelligent Systems that takes away the redundant work and allow us to work on new and exciting
problems.

I am currently pursuing my **Master's degree in Computer Engineering** from CSE department at TAMU, College Station, where my primary focus is in the field of **_Artificial
Intelligence and Applied Machine Learning_**.

I have worked as Senior Software Engineer, where I was primarily responsible to ensure product quality and deliverables.
