I am interested in building Intelligent Systems that takes away the redundant work and allow us to work on new and exciting problems.
I am currently pursuing my **Master’s degree in Computer Engineering** and my primary focus is in the field of **Artificial Intelligence and Applied Machine Learning**.
I have worked on projects exploring the fields of **Computer Vision/ Perception, Machine Learning Algorithms and Graphs**.

I have 6+ years of experience as a Software/Systems Engineer.

In my previous roles I have worked as:
- Test Owner : 
Responsible to lead a team of manual and automation testers and ensure the quality of a pilot SCADA product right from user story break down phase to Integration and System testing phase.
 
- Test Automation Design Engineer:
Develop windows form applications to automate the user stories comprising of desktop applications and websites. Build mini frameworks that would reduce the user story automation time.

- Database Test Analyst:
Build complex SQL queries matching the business requirements and validate the reporting system under test.
